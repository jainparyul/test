        I want to become a data scientist. Coding is my passion and I am learning and teaching the same. This is my first webpage and my attempt is to design this to the best. Wishing me all the luck. Have a great day and a very bright future ahead. Happy Coding ! Happy Teaching !
        Although I am not a creative person. I like to try my hands on art and crafts activities. Recently, I have developed interest in Mandala art and Bosai Farming. I have not yet begun with any and plan to start asap.
